# Web

I decided to make a space for me to have my personal profile on. The name has no meaning, I just liked the minimal look of it.
This is my first project working with HTML, CSS & JS and had no prior experience with them.
You may look trough the code and use them as inspiration for your own projects! :love_letter:
